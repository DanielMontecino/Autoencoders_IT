# Autoencoders_IT

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, in which I built a very simple neural network to demonstrate the information bottleneck theory for deep learning proposed by Naftali Tishby, and then I built a NN Autoencoder to study the mutual information between the layers and the input (wichs is the same as output).

This repository is inspired in the Yi Liu's repository: information-bottleneck
